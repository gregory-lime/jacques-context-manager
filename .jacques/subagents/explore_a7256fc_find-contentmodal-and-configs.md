Based on my search, I found that the ContentModal component and contentModalConfigs files do not exist in the gui/src directory. However, I did find the WebSearchBlock.tsx file.

Here are the results:

**Found:**
- `/Users/gole/Desktop/jacques-context-manager/gui/src/components/Conversation/WebSearchBlock.tsx`

**Not Found:**
- ContentModal component
- contentModalConfigs file

These files don't appear to exist in the current codebase. The gui/src directory contains various UI components and configuration files, but there are no files matching those names. The closest related files I found are:
- `/Users/gole/Desktop/jacques-context-manager/gui/src/components/ui/SearchInput.tsx` - a search input component
- Various modal-like components in other locations, but no ContentModal specifically

Would you like me to search for these files in a different location, or search for similar files that might serve the same purpose?
